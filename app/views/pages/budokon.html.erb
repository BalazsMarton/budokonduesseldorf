				<p class="justify">Budokon is an integral approach to the study of the universe and our relationship
within it through the study of the Yogic, Martial, and Living arts. Budokon has a six
pillar system which makes a body of science and philosophy used as a method to
provide a practical means of realizing the highest ideals in daily living. Rather than
separating different areas of human knowledge Budokon integrates them together.
Budokon studies the tree of life as a whole rather than limiting itself to one branch.
This tree is a great organization of diverse elements yoked together by the unifying
natural law. Budokon seeks to understand this law and teach its principles.</p>
