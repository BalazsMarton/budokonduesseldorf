		<p>Are you a social person, a team player? Do you prefer to workout with a small group of
other motivated individuals? Train in group &amp; share the cost, all while having fun with
your session partners and build better communication and trust between members of
a team!</p>
<p>
In this program, you get the benefit of receiving more personalized attention from a certified
personal trainer and mixed movement artist for the cost of a fitness class! It does not matter your
fitness level or age, because you will always go at your own pace. The classes are fun, fast and
effective in 30, and 60-minute durations combine a variety of types of exercises such as
cardio exercises, abdominal exercises, strength training and stretching for maximum weight loss
and toning. You will use free weights, bands, medicine balls, machines, outdoors, kettle bells,
TRX bands, and body weight. I will take you and your partner(s) through an amazing workout to
reach your fitness needs and goals.</p>
