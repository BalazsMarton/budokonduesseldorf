				<p>
In this workshops we explore our primal movement patterns and discover what our bodies are
capable to do by nature.</p>
<p>
We work on our flexibility, strength and coordination by creating mobility chains looking at the way
humans used to move and animals still do. We construct, deconstruct, progress and regress
quadrupedal movement patterns and will increase our range of motion to gain options in the way
we move to support a healthy and mobile life.</p>
<p>
Food is the fuel for a mobile life, therefore we will talk about and enjoy some special vegan food for
movers which is high in nutrition and supports performance and recovery.</p>
<p>
The workshop will be hosted by Attila and Svenja, experienced mixed movement artists, who
followed their movement education at the Budokon University in Miami.</p>
<p>
Please wear a fitted shirt covering your shoulders due to the floor work we do during the workshop.
There is no movement experience required, only a curious and playful mind-set.</p>
